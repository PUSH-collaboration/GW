# GW-EOS
PNS Eigenfrequencies from PUSH models with 6 different EOSs (Wolfe et al 2023)

### Data table columns
Series: metallicity series

Mass: ZAMS mass of the progenitor [Msun]

trise, kpush: parameters that control PUSH heating method

xi175, xi200, xi225: Compactness at bounce evaluated with M = 1.75, 2.00, and 2.25 Msun, respectively

Outcome: flag denoting outcome as determined by tracer postprocessing; 0 = 'explo', 4 = 'unclea'

M_rem: mass of the remnant, cold neutron star [Msun]

M_Fe: mass enclosed out to the iron layer in the progenitor

M_CO: mass enclosed out to the carbon/oxygen shell in the progenitor

M_He: mass enclosed out to the helium shell in the progenitor

M_H: mass enclosed by the hydrogen envelope in the progenitor

E_exp: explosion energy [10^51 ergs]

t_bounce: bounce time, in seconds of absolute simulation time [s]

t_exp: explosion time, in seconds of aboslute simulation time [s]

t_end: final simulation time [s]
